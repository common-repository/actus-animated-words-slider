== Description ==
= An image slider with a unique effect. =
<br>
**Mixing words and images of your post in an elegant animation.**
<br><br>
**ACTUS Animated Words Slider** is not just another image slider. You don’t need to hassle with hundreds of options. A unique, animated slider is created automatically for each of your posts, using the most used words of your text and all the images of your post. The featured image, attached images, the images used in your content, images used in galleries and any extra images you want to upload. The result is a beautiful animated slider, zooming and rotating the images, with soft transitions between them, and overlaying animated words from your text over the images.
<br>


= Features =
